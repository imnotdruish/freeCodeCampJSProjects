## What I learned

The course was a fun experience and helped to understand how JavaScript can be used to complete tons of different projects. I have some issues while working through the course, sometimes during the early projects there was some wording that made it difficult to figure out what they were asking to complete. However, through trial and error I was able to figure out that was required and progress through. I look forward to the other courses in Front End and Back End Development to further my knowledge in other frameworks.
